Include “contact your member” functionality via email, phone or twitter. Develop a process to connect the lookup tool to specific datasets of  organizations (ie: representative pages, etc.)


User Stories
==============================
USER STORY #1 (Sunlight Staff):
As a sunlight staff member I want to show examples of what our API's can produce in a clean user friendly format.

USER STORY #2 (Non-Profit Staff):
As a non-profit organization partnering with the Sunlight Foundation we want to be able to use sunlights research on our website to give members a way to interact with government info directly.

USER STORY #3 (Community Organizer):
As a community organizer I want a simple widget that interacts well with my campaigns home page so when doing doorknocking/outreach I can look up potential leaders' representatives, and quickly be able to contact them about our issue.

USER STORY #4 (Community Member):
As a community member who's neighborhood goes through lots of redistricting, I want to go to my local organization's site and find out who my most current representative is.
