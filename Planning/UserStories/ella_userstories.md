DESCRIPTION: These are the userstories for the Embeddable Legislative Alerts widget "Ella". Ella is a widget that uses the Sunlight Foundation's Scout tool; Scout makes it easy for anyone to follow the latest information on bills on a federal and state level as well as court opinions, federal regulations, oversight reports and speeches in Congress. Ella takes the "collections" Scout users create and allows them to embed a timeline of recent legislative and other activities on their own webplatform.  

USER STORY #1 (Staff):
As an employee at fakeorg that works directly with my org's website, I want a "Plug and play" widget that integrates seemlessly with the existing code for my website, a step by step guide for installation, and a widget that is completely bug free, so that I can add the tool to the website with little hassle. 

USER STORY #2 (Staff):
As an employee at fakeorg that uses my org's website as a resource, I want a tool that I can leave playing in the background that informs me anytime there is a major change to the bills that I am responsible for covering and be able to share them easily across social media platforms, so that I can communicate with my members and changes in important legislations and court decisions.

USER STORY #3 (Member):
As a member of fakeorg, I want to be able to go to my favorite organization's website and check the status of bills that matter to me, so that I can be up to date on any break in the political landscape. 

USER STORY #4 (Casual Observer):
As someone who is checking out the fakeorg webstie for the first time, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the app and navigate the content with ease, so that I don't become frustrated with the app and the website and leave.
