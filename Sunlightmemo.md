What languages do they code in?
	?????

What is the tool they want us to create?
	Widgets

What are widgets? 
	A web widget is a component, a “chunk of web page” that you provide for other 
	people to display data coming from your site on their own pages. A widget 
	typically contains a slightly complex mixture of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
	You will want to hide that complexity and make it as easy as possible for 
	people to include your widget on their pages. In order for someone to embed 
	this widget on their web page we need to provide them code..  We can develop 
	one that allows that person/organization/company to do that with just two HTML 
	tags: one script tag to load the widget and one container tag (div for example ) for them to determine the placement of that widget on their page.
